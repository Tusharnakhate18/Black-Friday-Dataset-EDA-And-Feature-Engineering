# Black Friday Dataset Analysis and Purchase Prediction
## Overview
This project aims to analyze customer purchase behavior during Black Friday sales and predict purchase amounts for various products. By understanding customer demographics and product preferences, retailers can tailor their marketing strategies and offerings more effectively.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about customer demographics, product details, and purchase amounts during Black Friday sales. You can find the dataset here.

## Files
1. blackFriday_train.csv: Training dataset with customer purchase details.
2. blackFriday_test.csv: Test dataset for purchase prediction.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/black-friday-analysis.git

2.Install the required Python libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook
2. Open and run the black_friday_analysis.ipynb notebook.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each cell and analyze the data.
## Approach
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and perform basic feature engineering.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize relationships between variables to gain insights into customer behavior.
- Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features and prepare data for modeling.
- Model Selection: Choose appropriate regression models for purchase prediction.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Train models, evaluate performance using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
## Model Evaluation
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Used to assess the accuracy of purchase prediction models.
## Future Work
- Experiment with different regression algorithms and hyperparameters to improve model performance.
- Incorporate additional features or external datasets for better predictions.
- Deploy the trained model for real-time purchase predictions in retail systems.
